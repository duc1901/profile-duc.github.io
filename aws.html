                            <p>Cloud computing, also known as serverless computing, is a technique that uses the
                                internet to store and manage data on remote servers, and then allows users to access the
                                data via the internet. Cloud computing customers do not own physical properties; they
                                rent them out to third-party service providers. </p>

                                successful because of its simplicity in its usage. They are a cost-effective solution
                                for enterprises. Optimal Server Utilisation, On-demand cloud services (satisfying
                                clients), and Dynamic Scaling, among other things, are all included in this package.
                                Google Cloud, for example, includes a suite of public cloud services offered by Google.

                                platforms and APIs to individuals, organisations, and governments. These web services
                                offer distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.
                                Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), on which users can create a virtual cluster of
                                computers at any time, provides computing resources that mimic almost all of a real
                                computer's attributes, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphic
                                processing units (GPUs). It includes local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSS storage, operating

                                                    SMS makes it easier to scale since there’s no need to add new

                                                    to the new database, by selecting the migration option. This allows

                                    <p>The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a set of standards that helps you
                                        build a scalable, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructure. The AWS
                                        Well-Architected Framework consists of best practices for the architecture of
                                        the cloud systems and processes. It does not limit itself to creating a
                                        structure for a set of functions and resources. It is also a process that you
                                        can iterate. AWS provides a set of tools for the analysis, planning, and
                                        building of cloud systems. We’ve provided the Cheat Sheet for AWS. Now, it’s
                                        time for you to head out and try what we’ve covered here and more.</p>
